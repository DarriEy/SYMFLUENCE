    - Routing: Can use mizuRoute for distributed runs

    Known gap: the unrouted distributed file is listed in
    :meth:`get_output_file_patterns` but cannot be served yet -- its
    ``q_routed`` is per-GRU runoff needing a sum over ``gru`` (what
    ``GRPostProcessor`` does), while :meth:`_extract_from_netcdf` reduces
    multi-dimensional variables by taking the first spatial index. It therefore
    raises rather than returning a single GRU's series. mizuRoute-routed output
    is unaffected: those variables are matched ahead of the GR-specific list and
    reduced by outlet selection.
