# In-tree models register through the `symfluence.plugins` entry points declared
# in pyproject.toml — one `symfluence_<name> = "symfluence.models.<name>:register"`
# per model. At `import symfluence`, the bootstrap (`core/_bootstrap._discover_plugins`)
# loads every entry point and calls its register(), the *same* non-privileged path
# external plugins use. There is deliberately no hard-coded model list and no import
# loop here: adding a model means creating the package with a top-level register() and
# declaring its entry point. `tests/unit/models/test_entry_point_dogfood.py` fails the
# build if the on-disk register() set and the pyproject entry points drift apart.
#
# NOTE: entry points are read from installed dist metadata, so a newly added or pulled
# model only becomes visible after `pip install -e .` regenerates that metadata.
# `_discover_plugins` logs a loud error if zero in-tree models are discovered (the
# stale-install signal).
#
# That register() is also where a model declares the knowledge core used to hold on
# its behalf — calibration bounds (`register_bounds` -> `register_model_bounds`) and
# spatial capabilities (`register_model_spatial_capability`), plus the schema in
# `models/config/model_config_schema.py`. Service decomposition, item 2: declaring at
# plugin-discovery time is what lets a model change its own bounds or capabilities
# without a core release, and is the only path an external plugin has. Stated here
# once rather than restated in each package's register().


#: Optional per-model facilities that register themselves as a decorator side
#: effect when a submodule is imported, mapped to the registry the import
#: populates.  See ``_declare_capability_modules``.

    modules by globbing this package's source tree from ``core``/``cli`` — an
    upward dependency on a distribution that may not be installed, and one that
    structurally cannot see external plugin packages.

    Instead this distribution *declares* the modules it owns (``add_module``)
    when it is imported, and the framework merely drains the declarations
    (``Registry.load_modules()``).  A model package — in-tree or external —
    can equivalently declare its own with
    ``model_manifest(forcing_adapter_module=..., init_preset_module=...)``;
    declarations are idempotent, so the two coexist while in-tree models
