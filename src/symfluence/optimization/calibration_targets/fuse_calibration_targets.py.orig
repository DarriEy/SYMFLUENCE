FUSE Calibration Targets (Backward Compatibility)

.. deprecated::
    This module has been moved to symfluence.models.fuse.calibration.targets
    as part of the effort to consolidate model-specific code.

    This re-export is provided for backward compatibility. Please update imports to:

        from symfluence.models.fuse.calibration import (
            FUSEStreamflowTarget,
            FUSESnowTarget,
        )

Migration Context:
    As part of the main migration to separate model-specific concerns, all FUSE
    calibration and optimization components have been moved to models/fuse/calibration/.

    Old location: symfluence.optimization.calibration_targets.fuse_calibration_targets
    New location: symfluence.models.fuse.calibration.targets
