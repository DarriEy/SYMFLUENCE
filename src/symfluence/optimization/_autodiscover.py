"""
Calibration component auto-discovery.

Each model registers its optimizer / parameter manager / worker via decorators
(``@R.optimizers.add('X')`` etc.) that only fire when the model's
``calibration.<component>`` module is *imported*. This helper scans every model
package and imports those modules so the decorators run.

The important behaviour here is *how import failures are reported*. There are
two very different reasons an import can fail, and conflating them is what made
the old bare ``except ... : logger.debug(...)`` so misleading:

* The model genuinely has no calibration support for this component (no
  ``calibration`` subpackage, or no ``optimizer.py``). This is expected for the
  many run-only models — log at DEBUG and move on.
* The module *exists* but raised on import — almost always a missing optional
  dependency (e.g. a compiled model binding) or a real bug in that module. The
  old code swallowed this at DEBUG, so the model silently vanished from the
  registry and the user later saw a baffling ``No optimizer registered for
  model: X``. We now surface these at WARNING with the actual cause.
