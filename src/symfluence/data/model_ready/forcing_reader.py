"""
Canonical forcing reader for the model-ready store.

Single entry point every model adapter should use to load basin-averaged
forcing. It guarantees the canonical CFIF vocabulary — CF standard names with
underscores (precipitation_flux, air_temperature, surface_downwelling_shortwave_flux,
surface_downwelling_longwave_flux, wind_speed, specific_humidity, surface_air_pressure)
— regardless of the source dataset (CARRA, ERA5, ...) and exposes the forcing
timestep via ``ds.attrs['timestep_seconds']``, so adapters never re-parse raw
variable names, units, or guess the timestep. Model-native layers (e.g. SUMMA's
Fortran binary) translate these to their shorthand via cfif.CFIF_TO_SUMMA_MAPPING.
