Spatial Mode Definitions for SYMFLUENCE Models.

Provides centralized spatial mode validation across all model runners.
This module defines the spatial-mode vocabulary, the *shape* of a model's
spatial capability declaration, and the validation logic that reads it.

Phase 3 Addition: Centralizes spatial mode validation that was previously scattered
across individual model runners.

Amended during service-decomposition prep (July 2026): the per-model VALUES are
no longer a table in this file. ``MODEL_SPATIAL_CAPABILITIES`` was a hardcoded
dict of 16 per-model declarations living in ``core``, which meant

* a model package could not change its own spatial capabilities without a core
  edit and a core release, and
* an out-of-tree plugin package could not declare them **at all** — it silently
  fell into the "unknown model" branch of :func:`validate_spatial_mode` and got
  no validation whatsoever.

:func:`register_model_spatial_capability` is the seam. It mirrors
``register_model_bounds()`` in
``core.calibration.parameters.parameter_bounds_registry``: core owns the record
type and the read side, the owning package contributes the values at
registration time, and the read side is unchanged for every consumer.

Why this shape rather than the alternatives considered:

* ``R.base_settings`` (a plain per-model string registry) carries untyped
  values and no notion of a structured declaration; a capability is a record
  with four fields and a merge policy, not a settings string.
* ``ModelConfigSchema`` / ``register_model_schema`` is the closest fit and is
  where ``spatial_mode_key`` already lives — but that schema is about *config
  keys* (installation/execution/input/output are all required fields), so a
  model would have to invent a full config contract just to say "I support
  lumped only". Several capability-declaring models (MHM, CRHM, PCRGLOBWB,
  WATFLOOD) have no such schema today. A dedicated registration function keeps
  the two declarations independent, exactly as ``register_model_bounds`` is
  independent of the schema.

The migration is complete: every declaration now lives in the ``register()`` of
the package that owns the model, and this module holds no per-model values at
all. A model contributes its capability at plugin-discovery time, exactly as an
external package does, so core can ship without the models distribution and a
capability change never needs a core release.

    at once: the exported name IS the live registry (so old importers and the
    new seam can never disagree), it is a genuine ``dict`` (so
    ``isinstance(..., dict)`` in third-party code still holds), and legacy
