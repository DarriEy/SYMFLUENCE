"""Discretization namespacing for model-ready forcing filenames (issue #339).

The naming contract that lets ONE model-ready forcing store hold several spatial
discretizations of the same domain side by side: a remapped forcing is written as
``{domain}_{forcing}_remapped_{token}_{datetag}.nc``, where ``{token}`` identifies
the discretization it was remapped onto. Writers (the remapping/resampling
builders) stamp the token; readers (every model's forcing load path) select by it.

This lives in ``core`` because both ends of that contract sit in different layers —
``data`` writes the names, ``core.modeling`` and the model adapters read them — and
the convention itself is pure string handling with no I/O and no upper-layer
dependency. Keeping it here is what lets the core forcing processor scope its read
without importing the data layer.
