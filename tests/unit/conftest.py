    ``get_model_executable`` falls back to the npm bundle when the source
    install is absent (#156 G6), and ``npm_bundle_bin()`` finds it via
    ``npm root -g`` whenever ``SYMFLUENCE_NPM_DIST_BIN`` is unset. On a
    developer machine that has the npm package installed, that fallback reaches
    a real ``dist/bin`` full of real binaries, so a test asserting "this
    executable is missing" resolves one instead — passing in CI and failing
    locally. Pointing the override at a path that does not exist makes
    ``npm_bundle_bin()`` return None (its documented contract for a
    non-directory override) and also spares every such test the ``npm root -g``
    subprocess. Tests that exercise the fallback set the variable themselves in
    the test body, which runs after this fixture and wins.
