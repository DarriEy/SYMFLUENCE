"""mizuRoute resolves its source runoff file from the registered declarations.

``MizuRouteRunner.fix_time_precision`` used to carry a 65-line if/elif chain
duplicating every model's runoff directory and filename -- the *fourth* copy of
that table, after ``runoff_loader``, the mizuRoute control writer, and the
schema each model registers. It now delegates to ``resolve_runoff_file``.

These tests pin the two things the collapse had to preserve: the source-model
precedence, and the filename each source resolves to.

CHANGED: HYPE left both. It is not a routable source — its runoff declaration
named ``{experiment_id}_timestep.nc``, which nothing in the HYPE adapter
writes, and its ``cout`` is already routed discharge at subbasin outlets, so
converting it would route it twice. With the declaration gone,
``resolve_runoff_file('HYPE')`` raises instead of resolving a path, and HYPE had
to leave the precedence too: otherwise a ``SUMMA,HYPE`` run would select HYPE
and fail where it previously routed SUMMA.
