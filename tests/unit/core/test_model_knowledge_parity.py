"""The behavioural specification for per-model knowledge moved out of ``core``.

Service-decomposition phase 0 moved per-model declarations into the packages
that own them (bounds -> ``register_model_bounds``; runoff / spatial-mode /
routing metadata -> the registered ``ModelConfigSchema``). This module is what
made that safe, and it now serves two distinct purposes — do not conflate them
when editing:

**Parity.** The bound values are pinned against
``data/model_bounds_snapshot.json``: every one of the 438 entries must survive
the split across model packages unchanged. Regenerate the snapshot ONLY when a
bound value is intentionally changed, never to make a failing test pass.

**Specification.** The runoff, routing and spatial-mode assertions started as
characterization — pinning stale values verbatim so the refactor was a provable
no-op — and several were then deliberately flipped to the CORRECTED behaviour
once the underlying bugs were approved for fixing (the routing-integration
table, the spatial-mode lookup, the unknown-source error, HYPE's removal as a
routable source). Each such test's docstring says what changed and why.

So an assertion here is a decision, not a mirror of the implementation. If one
fails, establish which of the two roles it is playing before touching it: a
parity failure means a value moved that should not have; a specification
failure means behaviour diverged from an agreed contract.

# Routing decisions (RoutingDecider)

def test_spatial_mode_keys_table():
    """Which models' spatial mode the routing DECISION is allowed to read.

    ``spatial_orchestrator`` derives ``f"{MODEL}_SPATIAL_MODE"`` by convention
    for every model and acts on it; the decision read a six-entry table. This
    is the same asymmetry just fixed for routing-integration keys, but the
    naive fix — one entry per declaring model — is wrong three ways, and the
    spec below is what handling all three produces.

    1. **A schema default must not decide.** ``config_dict`` is
       ``flatten_nested_config``'s output, and that dumps with
       ``exclude_none=True``, not ``exclude_unset=True``: a config that never
       mentions ``SWAT_SPATIAL_MODE`` still yields
       ``config_dict['SWAT_SPATIAL_MODE'] == 'lumped'``. At this seam an unset
       key is literally indistinguishable from an explicit one, so pydantic's
       ``model_fields_set`` is not reachable and no value-based trick recovers
       it (FUSE's *explicit* lumped and SWAT's *defaulted* lumped are the same
       string). Adding a ``lumped``-defaulting model would therefore let a
       value nobody wrote fire the veto branch, which sits ahead of
       ``ROUTING_MODEL`` and of the routing-integration check — silently
       turning routing OFF for users of the shipped template, which sets
       ``ROUTING_MODEL: mizuRoute`` alongside a lumped domain.

       So the answer to "should the key participate only when explicitly set?"
       is yes, and the way to get that property without provenance is to admit
       only models whose declared default is a *deferral* (``auto``). For those,
       an untouched config resolves to exactly the
       ``DOMAIN_DEFINITION_METHOD`` decision the model gets today: inclusion is
       a provable no-op until a user writes the key. Models whose typed default
       is a concrete mode join only by declaring ``spatial_mode_key`` on their
       ``ModelConfigSchema`` — a reviewed, per-model decision, which is what
       FUSE is.

    2. **``auto``/``default`` are understood.** The comprehensive template ships
       ``VIC_SPATIAL_MODE: auto`` and GR/MESH/VIC default to it. The decider
       used to compare that as a literal string, matching neither the lumped
       test nor the distributed one. It now resolves it from
       ``DOMAIN_DEFINITION_METHOD`` the way ``spatial_orchestrator`` does.

    3. **SUMMA stays an explicit exception.** There is no ``SUMMA_SPATIAL_MODE``
       field anywhere (``SUMMAConfig`` has no ``spatial_mode``); SUMMA's mode is
       ``DOMAIN_DEFINITION_METHOD``. It is in this table only because its
       schema says so, never by convention.

    Membership changes, all deliberate:

    * ``VIC`` joins (typed default ``auto``) — inert until ``VIC_SPATIAL_MODE``
      is set, and then it agrees with the orchestrator.
    * ``HYPE`` and ``NGEN`` leave. Both were dead: neither ``HYPEConfig`` nor
      ``NGENConfig`` declares a ``spatial_mode`` field, so neither
      ``HYPE_SPATIAL_MODE`` nor ``NGEN_SPATIAL_MODE`` exists as a config key and
      no template, test config or example sets one. They could only ever have
      matched a hand-built raw dict.
    * ``GR`` and ``MESH`` stay, and would now also qualify automatically.
