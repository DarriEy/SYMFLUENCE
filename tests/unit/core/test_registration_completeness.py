"""A model whose ``register()`` fails must not disappear quietly.

``core._bootstrap._discover_plugins`` deliberately never lets a broken plugin
take down the framework: any exception out of a model package's ``register()``
becomes ``logger.warning(...)`` and an absent model. That is the right runtime
behaviour and a terrible test posture — a package that loses its runner,
preprocessor, postprocessor, config schema, optimizer, worker AND parameter
manager all at once produces one log line and a green suite. A total WFLOW
registration failure was caught only by accident, via a 16-model spatial
capability table that happened to list it.

This module closes that hole two ways:

* **Completeness.** Every in-tree model package (derived from the installed
  ``symfluence.plugins`` entry points, not a hardcoded list) must resolve the
  execution-tier components ``Registries.validate_model`` calls required, plus
  its config schema. The models that legitimately register fewer are enumerated
  exactly, so both losing a component and quietly gaining one are red.
* **Silence.** A clean ``import symfluence`` in a fresh interpreter must emit
  no warning or error from the bootstrap logger, and must record no failed
  in-tree entry point. This is the guard that catches a registration failure
  in a package this file has no expectations about at all.
