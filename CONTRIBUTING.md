# Contributing to SYMFLUENCE

We welcome all contributions — from bug fixes and documentation improvements to new model integrations and performance optimizations. This guide outlines how to get started and how to collaborate effectively.

---

## 1. Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/SYMFLUENCE.git
   cd SYMFLUENCE
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/DarriEy/SYMFLUENCE.git
   ```

2. **Set up your environment**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/symfluence-bootstrap --install
   ```
   This will create and manage a `.venv` automatically.
   If you prefer manual setup:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/symfluence-bootstrap --help
   ```

## 2. Branching Strategy

SYMFLUENCE uses a simple branching model for organized development:

```
main          ← Protected, releases only (v0.6.0, v0.7.0, v1.0.0)
  ↓
develop       ← Active development, merge here first
  ↓
feature/*     ← Individual features
hotfix/*      ← Emergency fixes
```

### Working on Features

```bash
# Start from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Work, commit, push
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature description"
git push -u origin feature/my-feature

# Open PR to merge into develop
```

### Creating Releases

```bash
# When develop is ready for release
git checkout main
git merge develop
git tag -a v0.7.0 -m "Release v0.7.0"
git push origin main --tags
```

### Hotfixes

```bash
# For critical production bugs
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug main
# Fix and commit
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-bug
git tag -a v0.7.1 -m "Hotfix: critical bug"
git push origin main --tags

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/critical-bug
git push origin develop
```

## 3. Making Changes

### Code Style
- Follow **PEP 8** and use clear, descriptive variable names.
- Include **type hints** and informative **docstrings**.
- Keep functions focused and testable.
- Prefer explicit over implicit; avoid magic numbers.

### Type Checking Notes

SYMFLUENCE uses mypy for static type checking. Some files contain `# type: ignore` comments due to limitations in third-party type stubs:

| Library | Issue | Affected Modules |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| **matplotlib** | Incomplete type stubs for plotting APIs | `reporting/plotters/` |
| **xarray** | Complex generic types not fully captured | `reporting/processors/`, data modules |
| **pandas** | Some DataFrame operations lack precise types | Various data processing |
| **GDAL/rasterio** | C extension bindings have limited type info | Geospatial modules |

These suppressions are intentional and reviewed. When adding new `# type: ignore` comments:
1. Use the most specific form: `# type: ignore[error-code]`
2. Add a brief comment explaining why it's needed
3. Prefer fixing the type issue if possible

### Docstring Conventions
We use NumPy-style docstrings for consistency. Include:
- A one-line summary
- Extended description for complex functions
- Args/Parameters, Returns, Raises sections
- Examples for public APIs

```python
def calculate_runoff(precip: float, area: float) -> float:
    """
    Compute runoff from precipitation rate and catchment area.

    Converts precipitation depth rate to volumetric flow rate using
    standard hydrological unit conversions.

    Args:
        precip: Precipitation rate in mm/hour
        area: Catchment area in km²

    Returns:
        Runoff in m³/s (cubic meters per second)

    Example:
        >>> calculate_runoff(10.0, 100.0)
        277.78
    """
    return (precip / 1000) * area * 1e6 / 3600
```

### Running Tests
Before submitting a PR, ensure tests pass:

```bash
# Run quick tests (recommended before each commit)
pytest tests/ -m "not slow and not requires_cloud" -x

# Run full local test suite
pytest tests/ -m "not requires_cloud"

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/unit/          # Unit tests only
pytest tests/integration/   # Integration tests
pytest tests/e2e/ --run-full-examples  # End-to-end tests (slow)
```

See `tests/TESTING.md` for detailed testing documentation.

### Commit Messages
Use concise, descriptive messages:
- `Add FUSE model interface`
- `Fix NetCDF write bug`
- `Update optimization documentation`

## 4. Submitting Your Work

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-update
   ```

2. **Commit and push**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe your change"
   git push origin feature/my-update
   ```

3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
   Include:
   - **Description:** what and why
   - **Type:** new feature, fix, documentation, etc.
   - **Testing:** how it was verified
   - **Related issues:** e.g., "Closes #42"

Example:
```

## 9. API Stability and Versioning

SYMFLUENCE follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (SemVer):

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3)
```

### Version Guarantees

| Version Change | What It Means | Example |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **MAJOR** (1.x → 2.x) | Breaking changes to public API | Removing deprecated functions, changing return types |
| **MINOR** (1.1 → 1.2) | New features, backward compatible | Adding new models, new CLI commands |
| **PATCH** (1.1.1 → 1.1.2) | Bug fixes, backward compatible | Fixing calculation errors, typos |

### Public API Definition

The **public API** includes:
- All classes and functions exported in `__all__` from top-level modules
- CLI commands documented in `--help`
- Configuration file format (YAML keys)
- Python API: `SYMFLUENCE`, `SymfluenceConfig`, and exported exceptions

The following are **not** part of the public API:
- Internal modules (prefixed with `_` or in `internal/` directories)
- Undocumented functions or classes
- Debug/logging output format
- Specific error message text

### Pre-1.0 Stability

While SYMFLUENCE is pre-1.0 (currently 0.x.x):
- MINOR versions may include breaking changes (documented in CHANGELOG)
- PATCH versions are always backward compatible
- Deprecation warnings will be issued at least one MINOR version before removal

### Deprecation Policy

1. **Announce**: Deprecated features are marked with `warnings.warn()` and documented in CHANGELOG
2. **Grace period**: Deprecated features remain functional for at least one MINOR release
3. **Remove**: Removal is announced in CHANGELOG with migration guidance

### For Contributors

When making changes:
- **Adding features**: Increment MINOR version
- **Fixing bugs**: Increment PATCH version
- **Breaking changes**: Increment MAJOR version (or MINOR if pre-1.0), document migration path
- Always update `CHANGELOG.md` with your changes
