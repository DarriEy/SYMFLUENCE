## 4.9 Large-Domain Distributed Modelling

The large-sample experiment of Section 4.8 demonstrated SYMFLUENCE's ability to scale a single model configuration across 111 independent catchments. That experiment, however, treated each catchment as a lumped unit with no lateral routing between sub-basins. For regional water-resource assessment or flood forecasting, a distributed representation — in which precipitation is partitioned across spatially explicit response units and routed through a connected river network — is required. This section evaluates SYMFLUENCE's capacity to configure, execute, and calibrate a fully distributed hydrological simulation over the entire island of Iceland (~103,000 km²).

### 4.9.1 Domain and Experimental Design

The model domain encompasses the full island of Iceland within the bounding box 63.0–66.5°N, 25.0–13.0°W. Domain delineation follows the stream-threshold approach (threshold = 2000 grid cells on the Copernicus DEM), with coastal watershed extraction enabled to capture the numerous short, steep rivers that drain directly to the ocean without converging into larger trunk systems. The resulting mesh is discretised into Grouped Response Units (GRUs), each further subdivided into Hydrological Response Units (HRUs) based on 200 m elevation bands, five radiation classes, and eight aspect classes (Figure Xa).

The hydrological model is FUSE in distributed spatial mode, with lateral flows routed through the delineated river network using mizuRoute at an hourly routing time step. ERA5 reanalysis provides meteorological forcing at 0.25° spatial and hourly temporal resolution, with a fixed lapse rate correction of 6.5 °C km⁻¹ applied to air temperature. Thirteen FUSE parameters are calibrated simultaneously using DDS (Tolson and Shoemaker, 2007) with a budget of 1,000 iterations and KGE as the objective function (Table X). Parameter bounds are held identical to those used in the lumped per-catchment experiment (Section 4.8), enabling direct comparison of calibrated values between lumped and distributed configurations. The simulation spans 2008–2010, with a one-year spinup (2008), one-year calibration (2009), and one-year evaluation (2010). Observed streamflow from the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) is used for calibration and evaluation.

### 4.9.2 Distributed Configuration

The distributed configuration differs from the lumped per-catchment setup of Section 4.8 in three key respects. First, the entire island is represented as a single connected domain rather than 111 independent catchments, so water routed from an upstream GRU enters the downstream GRU through the river network topology. Second, the delineation produces a substantially finer spatial mesh: each GRU corresponds to a sub-basin of the stream network rather than a full gauged catchment, yielding GRU areas typically one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the lumped catchment areas (Figure Xb). Third, mizuRoute is invoked as an explicit routing component, reading gridded runoff from FUSE and producing reach-level discharge at every time step — a capability that was unnecessary in the lumped experiment where each catchment had a single outlet.

The SYMFLUENCE configuration for this experiment is specified in a single YAML file that sets `FUSE_SPATIAL_MODE: distributed`, `ROUTING_DELINEATION: distributed`, and `DELINEATE_COASTAL_WATERSHEDS: true`. All other workflow steps — DEM acquisition, intersection of forcing grids with the GRU mesh, parameter file generation, model compilation, and output evaluation — proceed through the same automated pipeline used for the single-catchment experiments in Sections 4.1–4.7, with no code modification required.

### 4.9.3 Framework Implications

This experiment tests three aspects of SYMFLUENCE's architecture that the preceding experiments do not exercise.

First, the distributed delineation and routing workflow demonstrates that SYMFLUENCE can scale from lumped single-catchment simulations to fully distributed regional domains without changing the underlying model code. The same FUSE executable and mizuRoute binary used in the lumped experiments are reused here; only the configuration file and the spatial inputs differ. This separation of spatial discretisation from model physics is central to the framework's design and ensures that users can transition between lumped and distributed representations by modifying configuration settings rather than rebuilding software.

Second, the coastal watershed delineation addresses a challenge specific to island and coastal domains: many rivers drain directly to the ocean through short, independent flow paths that are not captured by conventional pour-point-based delineation. SYMFLUENCE's `DELINEATE_COASTAL_WATERSHEDS` option identifies these terminal basins automatically, ensuring complete spatial coverage of the island without manual intervention.

Third, the integration of mizuRoute as a configurable routing component illustrates the framework's modular coupling strategy. Routing parameters (time step, output frequency, variable names) are specified in the same YAML configuration file as the hydrological model settings, and the data handoff between FUSE and mizuRoute is managed internally by the workflow engine. This design allows the routing scheme to be replaced or extended (e.g., with kinematic wave or diffusive wave methods) without modifying the hydrological model configuration.
