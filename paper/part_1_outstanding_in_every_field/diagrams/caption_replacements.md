## Body-Text Cross-Reference Errors to Fix Manually

- **Para 316**: "Figure 1 presents the simulated and observed SWE" — should reference the SWE timeseries figure (currently unnumbered, ~Figure 17 in sequence).
- **Para 374**: "Figure 12 presents the benchmarking results" — conflicts with the algorithm performance figure if numbered sequentially; resolve after renumbering.
- **Para 272**: References "Figure 5" for Iceland panels — this number is currently assigned to the data preprocessing pipelines figure; resolve after renumbering.
