"""Layering guard for the ``core`` package (RTI review item 19).

The architecture intends ``symfluence.core`` to depend on nothing above it:
every other top-level package (``models``, ``evaluation``, ``fews``,
``geospatial``, ``project``, ``data``, ``optimization``, ``cli``, ``agent``,
``gui``, ``tui`` ...) may depend on ``core``, but ``core`` must not depend on
them. This script walks the AST of every module under ``src/symfluence/core``
and flags imports of those upper layers.

Two severities:

* **Module-level imports** (executed at import time) are forbidden outright.
  These create hard, import-time coupling and are what inverts the layering.
* **Deferred imports** (inside a function/method body) are the accepted
  inversion-of-control pattern -- a small number of registry-seeding and
  data-driven-validation seams genuinely need to reach up at call time. Each
  one must be listed in ``ALLOWED_DEFERRED`` with a reason. A new deferred
  edge that is not on the list fails the check, forcing a conscious decision.

Two *kinds* of edge are scanned:

* **Static imports** -- ``import x`` / ``from x import y`` AST nodes.
* **String-built imports** -- module paths assembled as string literals or
  f-strings and resolved at runtime through ``importlib.import_module`` or a
  registry's ``add_lazy``. An AST-only scan is blind to these, so a genuine
  runtime upward edge such as
  ``importlib.import_module(f"symfluence.models.{model.lower()}.calibration.worker")``
  used to pass the guard silently -- which is exactly how a "removable" layer
  quietly becomes non-removable. Both kinds share the same severity split and
  the same allow-list.

Run directly (``python scripts/check_core_layering.py``) or via the mirrored
unit test ``tests/unit/core/test_core_layering.py``. Exit code is non-zero on
any violation.
